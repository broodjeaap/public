# Escape From Mars: Privacy policy

Thank you for trying out our Escape From Mars game for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by with some friends during our minor Game development and design. The source code is available on my Gitea repository under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
David
